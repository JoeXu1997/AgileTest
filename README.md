## Extra features

## Something I have to explain
In comment test I need to validate the data in other models' collections as well as in comment collection at the same time, and some data would be deleted afer the API operations so that the isolation principle would not be broken.So when I do PUT, DELETE and POST test in comment-test.js, I used describe.only() to test these three blocks separately。
